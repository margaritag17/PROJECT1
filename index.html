        <h1 class="center-align">10 reasons on why you should adopt!</h1>
        <ul>

            <li class="card-panel teal lighten-2">
                1. You save a life.

                All animals at our shelter are in need of a second chance. They have been lost, given up or
                abandoned. They are all unwanted and helpless. You are giving them a new life in a loving home.
            </li>

            <br>
            <li class="card-panel #33691e light-green darken-4">
                2. You help break the cycle of pet overpopulation.

                There are not enough homes for all the animals that are born every year. Adopting from a shelter
                helps
                weaken the pet overpopulation cycle. Each year 8 to 12 million dogs, cats, puppies and kittens are
                euthanized because there are simply not enough homes for them.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="card-panel teal lighten-2">
                3. You help stop cruelty in mass breeding facilities.

                Throughout the country, thousands of commercial pet-breeding facilities and backyard breeders
                produce
                millions of animals for sale in pet stores and through newspaper ads. Often known as puppy and
                kitten
                mills, these facilities repeatedly impregnate female dogs that spend their entire lives in cages
                without
                human companionship. These unfortunate animals are often in intolerable environments, forced to
                produce
                litter upon litter, and are destroyed after they become unprofitable assets. Adopting a shelter
                animal
                means you don’t support such cruel practices.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="card-panel teal lighten-2">
                4. You take advantage of adopting an adult animal.

                Adult pets are great! Often they are already housetrained and some can even “sit” or “stay.” You
                won’t
                have to deal with the “puppy phase” or the “kitten phase” which means less of that youthful energy
                such
                as biting, chewing, clawing, etc. You will be able to see the personality of the adult animal and
                won’t
                have to wait to see what you get.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="card-panel teal lighten-2">
                5. You get a lifetime resource with shelter employees and volunteers.

                People who work at the shelter will be a great resource to help you find information or resources
                for
                your pet. Our staff members work with animals every day and have a wealth of information on many
                different issues.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="card-panel teal lighten-2">
                6. You choose from a great selection of animals.

                Our shelter offers a variety that you won’t find anywhere else. We have specific breeds and also the
                greatest mutts you’ll ever find. We have more than 6,000 animals come through our doors every year!
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="card-panel teal lighten-2">
                7. You adopt a pet who has received good care.

                All animals that come to the shelter are admitted by experienced staff. They are given vaccinations
                upon
                arrival and go through a behavior screening process. (Please ask your Adoption Counselor for
                details).
                We have several vet partners that come to our shelter weekly and are there to assist us with health
                care
                issues and concerns.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="card-panel teal lighten-2">
                8. You support a valuable charity and community institution.

                Sadly, every community in America requires an animal shelter. When you adopt a pet from our shelter,
                you
                assist a not-for-profit organization, but also send a message to others who will be asking you for
                years
                to come where you obtained your adorable pet. Shelters improve the community by mandating that
                adopted
                animals be spayed or neutered. This requirement diminishes chances that more unwanted animals will
                enter
                the world.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="card-panel teal lighten-2">
                9. You pay less.

                Low adoption fees (which cover a portion of our shelter’s costs) are much less than the cost of
                purebred
                puppies or kittens sold for profit.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li class="card-panel teal lighten-2">
                10. You encourage others to adopt animals from shelters.

                When your friends ask where you got your amazing pet, you can tell them “at the shelter.” Your
                adoption
                may encourage others to do the same.
            </li>
